# Brox Optical Flow Implementation

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Brox et al. optical flow algorithm. The code estimates dense optical flow between consecutive frames in image sequences. It supports multi-level processing, various linear solvers, and flow visualization.  

## Features

* **Multi-level approach:**  Estimates flow at multiple image resolutions for improved accuracy and robustness.
* **Variational method:** Implements the robust variational optical flow formulation proposed by Brox et al.
* **Multiple solvers:** Supports different linear solvers (SOR, GMRES, BICGSTAB, CG) through the `scipy.sparse.linalg` library.
* **Residual computation:** Uses fixed-point iteration to compute the residual.
