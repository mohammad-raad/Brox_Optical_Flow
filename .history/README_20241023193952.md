# Brox Optical Flow Implementation

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Brox et al. optical flow algorithm. The code estimates dense optical flow between consecutive frames in image sequences, supporting multi-level processing, various linear solvers, and flow visualization.

## Features

* **Multi-level approach:** Estimates flow at multiple image resolutions for improved accuracy and robustness.
* **Variational method:** Implements the robust variational optical flow formulation proposed by Brox et al.
* **Residual computation:** Uses fixed-point iteration to compute the residual.
